# MachineLearningModels
This repository covers various Machine Learning models and simple implementations of how they work. I will continue to add to this list.

## Perceptron Learning Model
The perceptron Learning Algorithm was one of the first basic algorithms created. It is not multilayered but it is the foundation of a lot of other more complex models we use today.
